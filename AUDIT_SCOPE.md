## üì¶ Overview

The **MTYLD Ecosystem** bridges real-world HVAC business revenue into decentralized finance via three core on-chain components:

1. **MTYLD Token** ‚Äî the DAO‚Äôs primary revenue-backed asset.  
2. **MTYLD Vault** ‚Äî NAV-based yield vault providing a live price feed (`pricePerToken()`), representing the treasury‚Äôs on-chain balance of USDC and RWA yield.  
3. **LendingVaultGatedV3** ‚Äî a collateralized credit line that allows whitelisted users to borrow USDC against MTYLD collateral.

The ecosystem is designed for real-world businesses (Mechanical Temp) to tokenize earnings, provide on-chain transparency, and enable credit flow within the DAO framework.

## üß© Components and Relationships

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ MTYLD Token  
- ERC-20 token representing a claim on Mechanical Temp DAO revenue.  
- Used as collateral in LendingVaultGatedV3.  
- May be staked or held in the MTYLD Vault for yield.  
- Security Focus:
  - Validate total supply, mint/burn permissions, and transfer restrictions.
  - Verify no hidden mint functions.
  - Confirm ownership is DAO-controlled.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ MTYLD Vault  
- Accepts MTYLD deposits; holds USDC reserves.  
- Exposes `pricePerToken()` used for NAV-based collateral valuation.  
- Feeds live value to LendingVaultGatedV3.  
- Security Focus:
  - Validate NAV math and rounding safety.
  - Ensure no manipulation risk (e.g., deposits inflating NAV unfairly).
  - Confirm only trusted treasury can adjust balances.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ LendingVaultGatedV3  
- Accepts MTYLD as collateral; lends USDC.  
- Calculates LTV based on MTYLD Vault‚Äôs price.  
- Enforces borrow caps, maturity, late fees, and liquidations.  
- Security Focus:
  - Reentrancy prevention.
  - Correct handling of decimals and math precision.
  - Price feed validation.
  - Access control on roles.

## üö´ Out of Scope
- Off-chain Mechanical Temp HVAC operations or business processes.  
- Marketing or web assets (non-contract).  
- External stablecoin logic (USDC).

## üß± Security Model

| Feature | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Non-upgradeable** | All contracts are immutable once deployed. |
| **Whitelisted Lending** | Borrowing is restricted to approved DAO participants. |
| **DAO Governance** | Parameter changes (APR, LTV, etc.) controlled via multi-sig. |
| **On-chain Valuation** | NAV from Vault determines collateral value (no off-chain oracles). |
| **No Flash Loans** | No dependency on manipulable DEX oracles. |
| **Emergency Controls** | Pausing and severe liquidation restricted to guardians. |

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Known Considerations
- **Oracle Trust:** Vault‚Äôs NAV logic should be reviewed for manipulation resistance.  
- **Math Precision:** Collateral/debt conversions use 18‚Üî6 decimals ‚Äî must be reviewed for rounding safety.  
- **Centralization Risk:** Guardian and treasury roles must remain DAO-controlled.  
- **Collateral Locking:** Verify withdraw safety under high-debt scenarios.  
- **Late Fee Logic:** Flat penalty per maturity miss; ensure consistent application.  

---

## üîç Auditor Guidance
Auditors should:
- Confirm **role-based permissions** cannot drain vault funds.  
- Simulate **collateral value manipulation** scenarios.  
- Test **full lifecycle:** deposit ‚Üí borrow ‚Üí accrue ‚Üí repay ‚Üí withdraw.  
- Review **Vault price integrity** under changing USDC balances.  
- Verify **cross-contract calls** (`pricePerToken()` reads) cannot be spoofed.
