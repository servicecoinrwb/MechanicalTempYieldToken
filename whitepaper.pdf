% --- Introduction ---
\section*{Executive Summary}
\textbf{MTYLD} (Mechanical Temp Yield) is a digital asset designed exclusively for the stakeholders of Mechanical Temp. Unlike traditional cash bonuses which lose purchasing power over time, MTYLD is a backed asset that grows in value daily through the company's active treasury management and revenue injection strategies.

Think of it as a \textbf{high-yield savings account} combined with \textbf{company stock}, but with instant liquidity.

% --- How It Works ---
\section*{How It Works}
The value of MTYLD is derived from mathematical backing, not speculation.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\arabic*.}]
    \item \textbf{Real Revenue:} A portion of Mechanical Temp's HVAC service revenue is converted into USDC (Digital Dollars).
    \item \textbf{Treasury Growth:} Idle funds in the treasury are actively managed to generate low-risk yield (e.g., via secure stablecoin strategies).
    \item \textbf{Daily Injection:} We inject these earnings into the Vault every day. This increases the \textbf{Net Asset Value (NAV)} of every token in circulation.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{The Result:} If you hold MTYLD, your balance effectively grows every single day.

\section*{Why Participate?}

\subsection*{1. Superior Growth}
Your MTYLD tokens are backed by an actively managed treasury. The goal is to outperform traditional bank interest rates significantly, allowing your bonus to work as hard as you do.

\subsection*{2. Instant Liquidity}
You are never locked in. Unlike a 401k or stock options that vest over years, you can redeem your MTYLD for USDC (cash equivalent) instantly, 24/7, through our secure web portal.

\subsection*{3. Stability}
MTYLD is not a volatile cryptocurrency like Bitcoin. It is backed by stable assets (USDC). The mechanism is designed to go \textbf{up only} relative to the treasury backing.

\section*{The ``Bank of Mechanical Temp''}
\textit{Don't sell your upside just because you need cash.}

We have built an internal \textbf{Private Credit Line} for our partners.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Borrow Against Your Bonus:} If you have an unexpected expense, you can deposit your MTYLD as collateral and borrow cash (USDC) instantly.
    \item \textbf{Keep Earning:} While your MTYLD is deposited as collateral, it \textbf{continues to grow in value}.
    \item \textbf{Simple Terms:} No credit checks. No paperwork. The blockchain handles the collateralization automatically.
\end{itemize}
