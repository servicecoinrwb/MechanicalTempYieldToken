# üß© Rubrics ‚Äî MTYLD Ecosystem (Token, Vault, and Lending)

These rubrics define how the **MTYLD Ecosystem** ‚Äî including the **MTYLD Token**, **Mechanical Temp Yield Vault**, and **LendingVaultGatedV3** ‚Äî will be evaluated in an internal or external audit and grant review context.  
They adapt the structure of the *Arbitrum ‚ÄúNew Protocols and Ideas‚Äù* rubric to the real-world yield and DeFi framework of **Mechanical Temp (MTYLD)**.

---

## üéØ Evaluation Focus

The MTYLD Ecosystem uniquely merges **real HVAC revenue** with **on-chain yield and credit mechanisms**.  
Evaluation therefore focuses on:

- **Innovation & Novelty:** How effectively the system bridges real-world service revenue into DeFi.  
- **Revenue Transparency:** How clearly the DAO can prove real revenue flows on-chain.  
- **Measurable Impact:** Growth in TVL, redemptions, and USDC yield distribution.  
- **Security & Feasibility:** Smart contract safety and operational readiness.  
- **DAO Governance & Sustainability:** Long-term management through the Service Coin DAO.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Scoring Framework

Each category is rated **1, 3, or 5 points** to represent maturity and alignment.

| Category | Subcategory | Context | Red Flags | Score 1 | Score 3 | Score 5 |
|-----------|--------------|----------|------------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Team Strength** | Technical Expertise | Do the developers demonstrate Solidity and security expertise? | Incomplete contract coverage, poor documentation. | No Solidity or audit history. | Moderate contract experience with some audits. | Proven track record of deployed, verified contracts. |
| **Team Strength** | Operational Credibility | Does Mechanical Temp show ongoing real-world revenue and delivery? | No visible operations or off-chain proof. | Some operational data, limited transparency. | Full proof of real HVAC business + verifiable revenue deposits. |
| **Innovation & Novelty** | Protocol Design | How unique is the integration of RWA revenue with on-chain staking and lending? | Fork of existing models with no innovation. | Partial adaptation of yield models. | Fully original hybrid between DeFi and business yield. |
| **Innovation & Novelty** | Technical Architecture | Does MTYLD use efficient, modular contract design? | Centralized logic or no modularity. | Basic modular design. | Robust modular architecture with isolated risk per subsystem. |
| **Revenue Transparency** | Proof of Workflows | Are real HVAC jobs and revenues traceable to USDC inflows? | Manual updates or unverifiable sources. | Some proof via DAO reporting. | Fully transparent deposits verifiable on Arbiscan. |
| **Revenue Transparency** | Price Integrity | Are NAV and MTYLD price updates tamper-resistant? | Manual or manipulable updates. | Controlled by owner only. | Time-locked or DAO-approved NAV updates. |
| **Ecosystem Alignment** | Arbitrum Integration | Does MTYLD leverage Arbitrum features (low gas, composability)? | Deployed on testnet only. | Mainnet deployed but isolated. | Fully deployed and interacting with other Arbitrum protocols. |
| **Feasibility & Implementation** | Roadmap & Milestones | Are timelines for Vault + Lending upgrades realistic? | Undefined roadmap. | General targets only. | Detailed roadmap with testable milestones. |
| **Feasibility & Implementation** | Security Review | Is there an audit plan for all three modules? | No audits or test coverage. | Partial self-audit. | Professional audit and Hardhat tests with coverage report. |
| **DAO Governance** | Treasury Oversight | Are DAO safes and permissions correctly configured? | Owner-only control. | Multisig present, limited transparency. | Gnosis Safe + verified Snapshot governance. |
| **DAO Governance** | Sustainability | Will yield operations continue long-term without dilution? | Reliant on manual funding. | Partial revenue automation. | Fully automated Service Coin DAO revenue feed. |
| **Measurable Impact** | On-Chain Growth | Are KPIs like TVL, USDC reserves, and user count tracked? | No metrics or off-chain tracking. | Manual reporting. | Live subgraph + dashboard metrics. |
| **Measurable Impact** | Off-Chain Adoption | Is the HVAC business model scaling? | One-time demo only. | Active clients, low volume. | Ongoing monthly revenue with DAO allocation. |

## üßæ Example Scoring Application

| Subsystem | Key Strengths | Target Score (out of 5) |
|------------|----------------|--------------------------|
| **MTYLD Token (ERC20)** | Transparent mint/redeem flow, price-based NAV, DAO-managed fees. | 4 |
| **Mechanical Temp Yield Vault** | Real USDC treasury, delayed NAV application, strong security model. | 5 |
| **LendingVaultGatedV3** | Gated credit system with collateralized borrowing, APR logic. | 4 |
| **Service Coin DAO Oversight** | Snapshot + Gnosis integration. | 5 |

## üìà Weighted Evaluation

| Category | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Innovation & Novelty | 25% | How much real-world innovation is introduced. |
| Revenue Transparency | 20% | Verifiable, auditable revenue logic. |
| Security & Feasibility | 20% | Contract maturity and safety. |
| DAO Governance | 15% | Long-term decentralization and safeguards. |
| Measurable Impact | 20% | Tangible on-chain metrics and ecosystem benefit. |

## üß© Notes for Reviewers

- Favor *real-world substantiation* of yield over speculative growth models.  
- Require proof of HVAC revenue flow through verifiable transactions.  
- Emphasize cross-contract safety, especially between Vault and Lending.  
- Reward progress toward automated DAO-controlled operations.
